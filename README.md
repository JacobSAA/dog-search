## Running Locally
To run locally you must have [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en) installed and be able to run npm on the command line along with having [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) installed (which can be installed using npm).
* To initiallize the project naviagte to the project root folder and run `npm i`. This will install all the packages.  
*  Once that is done you can run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
